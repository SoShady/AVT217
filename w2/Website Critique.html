	<h1>Website Critique</h1>
	<h2>Good Websites</h2>
	<img src="img/Devir.png" alt="Yehuda Devir Homepage" width="50%">
	<p><a href="https://www.yehudadevir.com/one-of-those-days">Yehuda Devir Personal Website</a></p>
<p>The homepage is direct and immediately shows the portfolio. At the top, there’s a clean and clear way to navigate the site.
	<img src="img/Brianne.png" alt="Brianne Portfolio Page" width="50%">
	<p><a href="https://www.briannedrouhard.com/">Brianne Drouhard Portfolio Website</a></p>
It’s a bit smaller than the previous website, but it’s still clean and clear. The animated background is a nice touch and the simplified design allows it to run smoothly and not lag.
</p>
	<h3>Bad Websites</h3>
	<img src="img/Bad.png" alt="Collins Author Page" width="50%">
	<p><a href="http://www.suzannecollinsbooks.com/">Suzanne Collins Personal Website</a></p>
<p>The formatting of this website is bland. The colors are at least pleasing to look at, but the spacing is very inconsistent on the homepage.</p>
	<img src="img/Terrible.png" alt="Shopping Page" width="50%">
	<p><a href="http://arngren.net/">Possible Shopping Website</a></p>
<p>This website has no organization. There’s too many things going on and I can’t figure out easily how to navigate it or what it’s about.
